  # Because json_config_generator <0.1.3 depends on analyzer ^2.4.0 and no versions of json_config_generator match >0.1.3 <0.2.0, json_config_generator <0.1.3-âˆž or >0.1.3 <0.2.0 requires analyzer ^2.4.0.
  # And because json_config_generator 0.1.3 depends on analyzer ^3.1.0 and reflectable >=4.0.5 depends on analyzer ^5.4.0, json_config_generator <0.2.0 is incompatible with reflectable >=4.0.5.
  # So, because postgres_conf_lead_manager depends on both reflectable ^4.0.5 and json_config_generator ^0.1.1, version solving failed.
  # 3.0.8 is compatable with json_config_generator
  reflectable: ^4.0.5

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
